In fulfillment of the requirements for the Internet and Web Technologies module, I am undertaking a comprehensive web project that integrates Javascript, HTML, CSS, and phpMyAdmin. This project aims to demonstrate a dynamic and interactive website, showcasing my proficiency in front-end development using HTML and CSS, as well as my ability to enhance user experience through the implementation of Javascript functionalities. Additionally, the integration of phpMyAdmin will enable the creation and management of a relational database, thereby underscoring my grasp of back-end development and database administration. Through this project, I intend to highlight my skills in the full web development stack, providing a tangible example of my competence in creating modern and engaging web applications.
